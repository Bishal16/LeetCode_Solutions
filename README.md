# LeetCode_Solutions
This repository is synchronized using [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub), which means it updates instantly as I submit a solution in LeetCode and it passes all of the test cases.
##### NB: I started using LeetHub after solving 140 problems, therefore any previous solutions wouldn't be found here.
